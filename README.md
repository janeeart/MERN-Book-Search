## Description
This web application was created by modifying starter code. I was provided with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and I refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. I set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API. I modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. Finally, I created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
  
## Usage
This app allows users to log in and save book searches to the back end.
  
## Installation
The user will run ```npm run develop``` in the terminal to run the project locally on their computer.
